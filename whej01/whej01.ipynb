With a negative demographic index, the final justice index will be negative. Thus, communities suffering from vast environmental injustice can receive a negative Justice Index (implying there is little injustice) if their census population is below the national average. "

The *hist* function  creates 50 equally wide bins between the minimum and maximum values of the data. Each bin represents a group of values within a specific interval. The area of each bar/rectangle you see on the plot is proportional to the number of entries in the bin. The taller the bin, the larger amount of entries within the bin's interval.

    "Finally, to calculate a Lead Paint Environmental Justice Index for a particular region, that region's Demographic Index and Lead Paint Proximity Score is multiplied together to get a final EJ Index. Supposedly, the greater the index the more dangerous levels of lead paint are present. However, as we saw above (when looking at the demographic indexes), if a community's demographic index falls below the national average, that community automatically recieves a negative Demographic Index, and thus a negative Environmental Justice Score. This becomes an important issue because this calculation did not even consider the Lead Paint Proximity Score. Even if that community had a dangerously high Lead Paint Proximity Score, this calculation automatically gave them a negative EJ Score because of the census population data."

    "In addition, recall that a Demographic Index can take on a negative value if the Census Block Population falls below the national average. Without even considering the Environmental Quality Indicator (Lead Paint Proximity Score in our example), the final Justice Score is a negative value (indicating low levels of risk). However, just because a community falls below the census population, doesn't mean there is no hazardous risk present. As a result, this calculation can be misleading because certain communities will be categorized as having low risk, even though they may be at high risk but just happened to fall below the National Average in their Cencus Population."
