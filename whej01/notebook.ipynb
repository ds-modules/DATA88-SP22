This is due to the fact that the demographic index can be a positive or negative value depending on whether a census block is above or below the national average. With a negative demographic index, the final justice index will be negative. Thus, communities suffering from vast environmental injustice can receive a negative Justice Index (implying there is little injustice) if their census population is below the national average. ",

Supposedly, the greater the index the more dangerous levels of lead paint are present. However, as we saw above (when looking at the demographic indexes), if a community's demographic index falls below the national average, that community automatically recieves a negative Demographic Index, and thus a negative Environmental Justice Score. This becomes an important issue because this calculation did not even consider the Lead Paint Proximity Score. Even if that community had a dangerously high Lead Paint Proximity Score, this calculation automatically gave them a negative EJ Score because of the census population data.",

However, just because a community falls below the census population, doesn't mean there is no hazardous risk present. As a result, this calculation can be misleading because certain communities will be categorized as having low risk, even though they may be at high risk but just happened to fall below the National Average in their Cencus Population.",
